# Enforcement Scope

Full recipient/amount enforcement — spend caps, allowlists, per-transaction limits — is native and automatic for SAC token transfers (`transfer`/`transfer_from`), since these are the calls whose arguments the Soroban auth context exposes for inspection. For other Soroban contract calls made by the guarded account (arbitrary DEX/lending/protocol calls), the policy engine still enforces window and pause state, but per-call amount/recipient limits are not yet enforced — extending fine-grained enforcement to arbitrary calls is tracked as a v2 item, not implied as already covered.

This boundary is an inherent property of the platform (the auth context does not expose arbitrary call arguments generically), not a gap this project hides or overclaims. The classification that produces this boundary (`AssetTransfer` vs `Protocol` vs `Unknown` default-deny) is spelled out in SPEC §6.
